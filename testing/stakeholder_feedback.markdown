## Initial design

Summary: There was a lot of feedback surrounding potential additions to the GUI. Out of which, only one was feasible given my timescale. The suggestion was to allow players to choose the symbol they want to use instead of forcing noughts and crosses. This has been recieved and will be tried implemented in the second sprint (Update: Further research into stakeholder reveals it was 'filler', and therefore will not be implemented).

## Sprint 1

Summary: The feedback for Sprint 1 was varied. The general concensus was that aesthetics should be improved, but the suggestion for a score system was brought up. I will act on both of these suggestions in Sprint 2.

## Sprint 2:

Summary: The feedback for Sprint 2 was plentiful. Among the stakeholder feedback, I will implement different color lightups for different symbols, attempt to fix the score labels aesthetics and a button that allows the player to swap between player and bot. In addition I will improve the overall GUI of the program for aesthetic purposes.
