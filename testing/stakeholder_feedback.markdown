Summary: There was a lot of feedback surrounding potential additions to the GUI. Out of which, only one was feasible given my timescale.

Summary: The feedback for Sprint 1 was varied. The general concensus was that aesthetics should be improved, but the suggestion for a score system was brought up. I will act on both of these suggestions in Sprint 2.
