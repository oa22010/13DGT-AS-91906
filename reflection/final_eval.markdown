# Final Evaluation
### _What went well_
__Scheduling and planning:__  
The scheduling process of this project was relatively simple and easy. While, yes, I had plenty of time to complete this project, it's not about that. I made vague (gu)estimates of when certain aspects of my project should be done, and these coincided well with my working pace. This ensured I was not overly stressed, but still felt the need to work regularly on the project. I have no doubt this maximised efficiency.

__Feedback gathering:__  
I gathered feedback via sending google forms to my stakeholders, and recording their replies. This versatile and simple platform allowed me not only to clearly see my feedback, but also seamlessly transfer said feedback into a sheet, allowing me to compare stakeholders suggestions with ease. It also allowed me to send reminders to my stakeholders, increasing efficiency greatly. Overall the process was smooth and possibly the most satisfyingly simple task of my project.

__Research and learning process:__  
As I will mention later on in this evaluation, I went into this project expecting my prior knowledge to be sufficient to complete most of this project's code, if not all. I was sorely mistaken. Despite the difficulties I faced, one thing I had no difficulty with was researching and learning how to overcome these difficulties. This project pushed me to learn much more about Tkinter, and indeed Python coding in general. With the assistance of my teachers' lessons and the site w3schools, I had no issue accessing the information I needed to complete the coding aspect of this project. Not only did this process of the project go well, it also greatly added to my coding knowledge.

__Stakeholder satisfaction__  
I am happy to affirm that all of my stakeholders were satisfied with my project. While their feedback could sometimes be harsh, the satisfaction of them approving of my work made it all worth it. My stakeholders, upon seeing my final GUI, all agreed I had done enough to merit stopping.

### _What didn't go as planned_
__Underestimation of code difficulty:__  
As I mentioned previously, my code required much more knowledge than I had going into this project. I had no idea how to use classes were to be used or utilized (and honestly I don't even know if I used them properly). This caught me by surprise for a short period of time, but, as mentioned, wonders of education (physical and online) came to the rescue.

__Log syntax/format inefficiency:__  
In this project the only platform I used to log or record information was Markdown files. While this was adequate in the beginning of this project, I soon discovered that Markdown, in comparison to platforms like Google Docs, fell short in many aspects. However, Markdown files provide an effiency that was unparalleled to Google Docs. Instead of having to manually insert linkes to Google Docs, I just added files. However the compromise was unexpected.
